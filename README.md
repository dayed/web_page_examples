csv_to_datatable
================

Uses JQuery to show the functionality of loading CSV data straight into the DataTables jQuery plug-in.


The HTML page consists of a textarea, two buttons and a table. CSV data can be entered straight into the textarea 
and upon clicking the 'Populate' button a table is immediately generated to display the data.

The first line of the CSV data is processed as the header fields and all following lines as data.

To make it easier to test and use, two links have also been included that will direct the user to sites that 
provide the service of generating test CSV data. 
These sites are:  http://http://www.mockaroo.com/ and http://www.generatedata.com/.

The scripts used in this example consist of:

jQuery - http://jquery.com/

DataTables - http://www.datatables.net/

jquery-csv - https://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/
